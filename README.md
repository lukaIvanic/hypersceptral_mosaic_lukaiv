Utilities and helper functions for the Hyper-Object Challenge:
Reconstructing Hyperspectral Cubes of Everyday Objects from Low-Cost Inputs.

- Website: https://hyper-object.github.io/

This repository provides lightweight dataset utilities, transforms, and loaders to help you train and evaluate models for the Hyper-Object Challenge. Baseline models and evaluation scripts will be added later (see placeholders below).


## Challenge at a glance

Two tracks are offered. Both aim to reconstruct high-fidelity hyperspectral cubes spanning 400–1000 nm (61 bands).

- **Track 1 — Spectral Reconstruction from Mosaic Images**
  - Input: single-plane mosaic image (H×W×1) with a 2×2 CFA pattern (RGGB).
  - Output: hyperspectral reflectance cube (H×W×61) in [0, 1].

- **Track 2 — Joint Spatial & Spectral Super-Resolution**
  - Input: low-resolution RGB image captured with a commodity camera.
  - Output: high-resolution hyperspectral cube with C ≫ 3 and spatial upscaling.


Submissions are ranked by Spectral-Spatial-Color (SSC) score, range in [0,1].
- Spectral: SAM, SID, ERGAS
- Spatial: PSNR, SSIM on a standardized sRGB render (D65, CIE 1931 2°)
- Color: ΔE00 on the same sRGB render

## Quick Start
1. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/hyper-object/2026-ICASSP-SPGC`
2. Download the dataset from `https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/2026-icassp-hyper-object-challenge-track-1/data` and `https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/2026-icassp-hyper-object-challenge-track-2/data`

The folder structure for track 1 and 2. Note that you should have a pair of (mosaic, hsi_61) if you download the data for track 1, else (rgb_2, hsi_61) ffor track 2.
```

## Loading Data

The examples below demonstrate how to load the Hyper-Object dataset and apply paired transforms.

```python
    # Imports:
    import torch
    from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

    from datasets.hyper_object import HyperObjectDataset
    from datasets.pairing import ModalitySpec
    from datasets.base import JointTransform
    from datasets.transform import random_flip

  
    # Create the dataset and dataloader:
    ds = HyperObjectDataset(
        data_root="data/track1",
        train=True,
        transforms=JointTransform(random_flip),
    )

    loader = DataLoader(
        ds,
        batch_size=2,
        shuffle=True,
        num_workers=4,
        pin_memory=True,
    )
```

## Baselines
Two baseline methods are provided in `baselines` folder. 
- raw2hsi.py provides a CNN+PixelShuffle approach to reconstruct 61 bands HSI cube from Raw Mosaic data, i.e., mosaic -> hsi_61
- mstpp_up provides a modified mstpp approach to jointly reconstruct the spectral and spatial resolution of HSI cube from a low resolution RGB. 

Additional CPU-friendly baselines added:
- baselines/linear_mapper.py: Linear Tile Mapper (1x1 conv in packed space + PixelShuffle).
- baselines/pca_mapper.py: PCA-coefficient mapper with fixed spectral basis (compute via `tools/compute_pca_basis_track1.py`).

Training:
- Track 1 linear: `python track1_train.py` (uses LinearRaw2HSI by default).
- Track 1 PCA: `python tools/compute_pca_basis_track1.py --data_dir data/track1 --k 12` then `python track1_train_pca.py --pca_basis runs/track1/pca/pca_basis_k12.npz`.

Submission (CPU):
- Simple: `python track1_submission.py --ckpt runs/track1/mosaic2hsi_baseline_v3/model_best.pt --model linear`
- With TTA: `python track1_submission_tta.py --ckpt ... --model linear`

To train the baseline models, you can run the `track1_train.py` for track 2 and `track1_train.py` for track 2.

## VRAM Requirements
If you use our baseline with our training config, below is the expected compute needed:
- Training Track 1: Requires `~18GB VRAM`
- Training Track 2: Training `~42GB VRAM`

## Evaluation
We will use the Spectral-Spatial-Color (SSC) score for evaluation. The SSC score, ranges from 0 to 1 (higher the better), computes the reconstruction performance from the following three aspects:
- Spectral: SAM, SID, ERGAS
- Spatial: PSNR, SSIM on a standardized sRGB render (D65, CIE 1931 2°)
- Color: ΔE00 on the same sRGB render

When you submit your prediction on Kaggle, it will return you the single SSC score. Please refer to our Kaggle page on how to prepare the submission file.
